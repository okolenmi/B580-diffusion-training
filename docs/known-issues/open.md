# Open

- **[2026-08] `DeviceResident.footprint_bytes()` doesn't check actual
  device placement anywhere.** Surfaced while investigating a VRAM
  report later found to have a different, unrelated root cause (see
  "Pending user testing" below): `tracked_footprint_mb` was consistently
  reported *higher* than `vram_allocated_mb` in real profiling output,
  backwards from what static-weight-only accounting vs. real
  allocated-including-activations should show. Not traced further --
  still open, independent of the VRAM-ratchet finding below (that one's
  fully explained by the allocator's `reserved` behavior on an uncapped
  image long side, doesn't touch `footprint_bytes()` at all).

- **[2026-07] "Device lost" errors and silent training hangs after
  VRAM-pressure events, reported from real ComfyUI use (legacy `core/`
  pipeline, not `nodes/`).** User-reported, not yet investigated here.
  Symptom: not a normal OOM -- either a device-lost error or a silent
  hang, most reliably reproduced by a VRAM-heavy sequence (merging three
  6GB models, generating with an intermediate merge state, then
  generating again with a different base model) and, separately, seen in
  this project itself after a VRAM spike during preview generation's VAE
  decode step -- loss of a few hundred MB stabilizes (frees back down)
  but training hangs a few steps later *despite* free VRAM being
  available afterward. User's own read, worth taking seriously: something
  gets offloaded under memory pressure but isn't correctly loaded back,
  even though there's room for it. Likely related to the "Persistent
  ~500MB VRAM growth after preview generation" entry below (same VAE
  decode trigger point) but the *symptom* here (hang/device-lost, not
  just VRAM not dropping back down) is a distinct, arguably more serious
  report -- not confirmed to be the same root cause, not assumed to be
  either. A `kohya-ss/musubi-tuner` discussion training Wan2.2 on the
  same B580 hardware describes a matching hang-after-offload symptom,
  traced there to a `synchronize_device()` call missing its `device`
  argument on the non-CUDA path -- a plausible root-cause *shape* (async/
  non-blocking transfer without a matching explicit synchronize on the
  XPU path) worth checking `core/trainer.py`'s own offload code for, not
  a confirmed diagnosis here. Not investigated further this session --
  out of scope for `nodes/`-only work, and needs `core/trainer.py`,
  which `nodes/` doesn't touch.
